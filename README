A small python script to append flymake compatible syntax check rules to Makefiles generated by CMake.

Example:

$cmake CMakeLists.txt
$flymake-it

Now every Makefile (including the subdirs) will have a syntax-check rule.

It's also include the scripts cmake-fly and ccmake-fly to make the job easier,
those scripts just call cmake and then flymake-it. To use them is need to
backup the cmake originals executables as on the system path:
cmake to cmake-origin
and
ccmake to ccmake-origin
